# STAI

<h1>Hello !</h1>
<p>This is the readme of our final project with some details about how we have built the model!</p>
<p>A little note: due to lack of time and experience in AI, the code in this notebook is 100%
 AI generated code because of many errors occured while writing the code for unknown reasons so i think we opted more to copy-paste method </p>

 <h1>Why we opted on tensorflow as a framework?</h1>
<p>Of course,because it's the most suitable framework for beginners like us in AI and also it feels like a lego when we can assemble everything</p>
<p>Dataset</p>
<p>Note: With a little bit of luck, we found that the dataset used in the collab provided in this hackaton is already integrted in Tensorflow databases so we opted for importing dataset using tensorflow_datasets package</p>
